GUI Basics

"...a variety of GUI toolkits and builders are available for Python programmers: tkinter, wxPython, PyQt, PythonCard, Dabo, and more. Of these, tkinter ships with Python, and it is something of a de facto standard.

tinkter is a lightweight toolkit and so meshes wwell with a scripting language such as Python; it's easy to do basic things with tkinter, and it's straightforward to do more advanced things with extensions and OOP-based code. As an added bonus, tkinter GUIs are portable across Windows, Linux/Unix, and Macintosh, simply copy the source code to the machine on which you wish to use your GUI. tkinter doesn't come with all the bells and whistles such as wxPython or PyQt, but that's a major factor behind its relative simplicity, and it makes it ideal for getting started in the GUI domain

example of a tkinter code:

from tkinter import *
Label(text='Spam').pack()
mainloop()
